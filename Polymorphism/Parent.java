/* 
 Runtime polymorphism: It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. 
 It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. 
 This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding.
 
Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition 
for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
